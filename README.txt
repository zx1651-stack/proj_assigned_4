about 23 hours late, so I think it should be minus 10 points?

There are 3 enemies:
The wandering witch, the bullet, and the ball, while the ball is the follower

use "a", "d", "w" to control the ghost.

Collect all 3 keys and then the door will be rendered. 

Hit the door to escape to the next level.

When you collapse with an enemy, gLives -= 1

2 looping music and 3 sounds (
	get.mp3 when collapsing with a key
	win.mp3 when successfully escaping from each level
	game_over.mp3 when losing gLives (It says game_over in name but is not just for game_over)
)
